# Business Perspective for Predictive Maintenance

_This section is adapted/some sections copied verbatim from the [Playbook for Predictive Maintenance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/cortana-analytics-playbook-predictive-maintenance)_

Unscheduled equipment downtime can be very expensive for businesses. It is critical to keep field equipment running in order to maximize utilization and performance and by minimizing costly, unscheduled downtime. Simply, waiting for the failure to occur is not affordable in todayâ€™s business operations scene. To remain competitive, companies look for new ways to maximize asset performance by making use of the data collected from various channels. One important way to analyze such information is to utilize predictive analytic techniques that use historical patterns to predict future outcomes. One of the most popular of these solutions is called Predictive Maintenance which can generally be defined as but not limited to predicting possibility of failure of an asset in the near future so that the assets can be monitored to proactively identify failures and take action before the failures occur. These solutions detect failure patterns to determine assets that are at the greatest risk of failure. This early identification of issues helps deploy limited maintenance resources in a more cost-effective way and enhance quality and supply chain processes.

With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, predictive maintenance has been gaining increasing attention in the industry as the data collection and processing technologies has matured enough to generate, transmit, store and analyze all kinds of data in batches or in real-time. Such technologies enable easy development and deployment of end-to-end solutions with advanced analytics solutions, with predictive maintenance solutions providing arguably the largest benefit.

Business problems in the predictive maintenance domain range from high operational risk due to unexpected failures and limited insight into the root cause of problems in complex business environments. The majority of these problems can be categorized to fall under the business questions tabulated below.

|#|Common Problem |
|-|---------------|--------------|
|1| Probability that an equipment fails in the near future |
|2| Remaining useful life of an equipment |
|3| Predominant Causes of failure of an equipment |
|4| Maintenance actions to be done on an equipment |

By utilizing predictive maintenance to answer these questions, businesses can:
- Reduce operational risk and increase rate of return on assets by identifying failures before they occur.
- Reduce unnecessary time-based maintenance operations and control cost of maintenance
- Lower inventory costs by reducing inventory levels by predicting the reorder point
- Discover patterns connected to various maintenance problems
- Improve overall brand image, eliminate bad publicity and resulting lost sales from customer attrition.
- Get key performance indicators such as health scores to monitor real-time asset condition
- Plan capital allocation based on estimates of the remaining lifespan of assets
- Get recommendation for proactive maintenance activities and estimated order dates for replacement of parts.
